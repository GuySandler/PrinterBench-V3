I made a website to help people choose their printer.
This is community made so you can add your printer and give reviews for others to see on a leaderboard, compare existing printer's stats, and save printers as favorites to your profile
If you have a 3d printer please add it to the database by filling out the form and feel free to give any feedback or suggestions
